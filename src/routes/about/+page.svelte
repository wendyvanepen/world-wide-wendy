		From a young age, I was always interested in computers and the internet. I started building
		websites when I was around 11 years old. I used to stay up late, focusing on the issues I would
		encounter while building my dream websites. Up until today, I still experience the same focus
		that makes me forget the hours and keep me glued to my screen. When I had to choose a study, I
		wasn't ready to embrace my nerdy side yet. I chose to pursue a career within sports management
		instead.

				Fast forwarding to 2017, I decided that a master's degree in Marketing wouldn't still my
				hunger for and signed up for a sped-up bachelor course software engineering. While the
				switch wasn't an easy one, my passion for coding and building websites was still there.

				At the moment with over 5 years of developing in the pocket, I'm putting on different hats
				in the front-end world and expanding my knowledge where I can. I have a great sense of
				detail, a strong feeling for customer journeys and I can spot a misplaced pixel from a mile
				away. With the world becoming more aware of what inclusive means, I feel I can make a
				difference in encouraging people to do the same in the digital world.

			In 2016 I temporarily moved to the Swiss mountains to teach snowboarding.
		</p>
		<p>
			It gave me the first real taste of traveling and living alone and it was love at first sight.
			A few months after my stay I booked a solo trip to Morocco. With multiple world trips in my
			pocked a new desire showed up: what if I combined my passion for traveling and work? The
			pandemic has taught us the endless possibilities of working remote. But as an extravert, I
			find it hard to keep connected to my team while traveling full-time.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			So what's my solution? Well to be quite honest, I haven't got one. I'm still figuring out the
			perfect balance. But for now, I try to escape the Dutch winter and travel to a warmer place
			for a few months. I have great friends and family that I can't miss full-time, but who knows
			what I'll decide on next year?

			I'm not a talented gal, as in - I've never been the type of girl to pick up a sport right away

			love I can't stop chasing.
